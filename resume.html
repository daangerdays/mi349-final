        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Abbey Ledford and I am a junior Information Science major at Michigan State University, I am interested in UI/UX design. This portfolio is intended to show you the set skills that I have honed in during my time at Michigan State, as well as capabilities that would set me apart from other applicants. I have an understanding of both Python as well as HTML, and I would consider myself a great team player and problem solver.</p>
